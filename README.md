## Explanation of Version Control**
**Version control** is a system designed to manage changes to files made by **multiple collaboraters** over time, especially in software development.  It allows teams to track modifications, revert to previous versions, and work concurrently without conflicts. There are **two primary types** of version control systems: **centralized** and **distributed**. Centralized systems, like Subversion (SVN), have a single central repository where **all files are stored**, requiring users to check out files to work on them. In contrast, distributed systems, such as Git, allow **each collaborator to have their own local repository**, enabling them to work offline and commit changes independently before syncing with the central repository. Version control systems also include features like branching and merging, which enable developers to create separate lines of development for new features or bug fixes. Once the work is complete, these branches can be merged back into the main codebase, integrating the changes seamlessly. Additionally, many version control systems support collaboration tools, such as pull requests and code reviews, which help ensure code quality and maintain consistency across the project. By using version control, teams can streamline their workflows, reduce the risk of data loss, and enhance overall productivity, making it an essential practice in modern software development.
